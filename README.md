# 👋 I’m @adjstreams

### Xennial dad 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦, coder ⌨️, gamer 🎮, geek 🤓, and twitch streamer 🔴

This is a place for me to dump various scripts and tools I've cobbled together for my streaming purposes.

They might not be that useful to others in their current state without some significant modifications.
If there is any interest, I'll make changes to support others being able to use them.
